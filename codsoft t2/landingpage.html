                <p>Pandora’s Box has been opened on the Fortnite Battle Royale Island, bringing Olympus to the battlefield. 
                Olympian legends — including Hades and the thunder god Zeus — now rule the Island in otherworldly rage. 
                To make matters worse, they’ve
                 brought their powers and weapons with them.
                  Use their mythological means against them in Chapter 5 Season 2: Myths & Mortals!</p>

                <h1> NEW CHARATERS <br>TO UNLOCK</h1>
                <p>The line up of Fortnite characters has seen another update, and although this means we say farewell to Brutus for the time being, 
                    there are now two fresh faces to meet in the form of Apollo and Graveheart, which has also caused a couple of the other characters 
                    to move locations. We still have the Fortnite NPCs connected to the Elements event, so look out for Aang, 
                    Katara, Toph, and Zuko at various Fortnite Elemental Shrines where you can also pick up Mythic bending techniques to boost your abilities</p>
